    ### In this application i practiced image analysing and manipulation activities .


    1. face impression detection on web cam 
        we can improve this to detect more functions withing the face detection

    ### Running the Examples
    Clone the repository:
    git clone https://github.com/mirosh-kavinda/happyfunc.git
    <br>
    cd happyfunc<br>
    npm i<br>
    npm start<br>
    Browse to http://localhost:3000/.<br>

    The available models for face detection, landmark detection, and face recognition vary in terms of accuracy, size, and flexibility. The best model for you will depend on your specific needs.
    <br><br>
    Face detection models are used to identify faces in images or videos. The SSD Mobilenet V1 model is a good choice for high accuracy face detection. It is a bit larger than the other models, but it is still relatively lightweight. The Tiny Face Detector model is a good choice for real-time face detection. It is much smaller than the other models, but it is not as accurate. The MTCNN model is a good choice for flexibility. It can be configured to detect a wide range of face sizes.<br><br>
    68 point face landmark detection models are used to identify 68 specific points on a face. These points are often used for face recognition and facial expression recognition. The Face Landmark 68 Model and Face Landmark 68 Tiny Model are both good choices for accurate face landmark detection. The Face Landmark 68 Model is larger than the Face Landmark 68 Tiny Model, but it is more accurate.
    Face recognition models are used to identify faces based on their unique features. The Face Recognition Model is a good choice for face recognition. It is trained on a large dataset of faces, so it can recognize faces with high accuracy.
    Face expression recognition models are used to identify facial expressions. The Face Expression Recognition Model is a good choice for detecting facial expressions. It is trained on a variety of images, so it can recognize a wide range of expressions.
    I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.
