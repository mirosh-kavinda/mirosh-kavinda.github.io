# Portfolio React Application 

Welcome to my Portfolio React Application! This project showcases my skills and experience in web development, particularly in React.js. It is a responsive and mobile-friendly website with a clean and modern design. The application integrates various technologies, including Medium-API for fetching data from Medium articles, EmailJS for email services, and Markdown for reading markdown files. The project also features a blog section where I share my thoughts on technology and design.

### Features
Responsive Design: The website is designed to adapt to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal viewing experience on various devices.

Blog Section: I have included a blog section where I share my insights, ideas, and experiences related to technology and design.

Medium-API Integration: The application fetches data from my Medium articles using the Medium-API, providing visitors with easy access to my latest blog posts.

EmailJS Integration: Visitors can contact me directly through the website using the EmailJS service, making it convenient for potential employers to get in touch with me.

Markdown Support: Markdown files are used for easy content creation and management, allowing me to update the website's content effortlessly.
