<h1 class="center"> Portfolio React Application </h1>

I recently developed a portfolio website using React JS. I used the following dependencies:
•	Medium-API for fetching data from Medium articles
•	EmailJS for email services
•	Markdown for reading markdown files
The website is responsive and mobile-friendly, and it features a clean and modern design. It also includes a blog section where I can share my thoughts on technology and design.
I am proud of the work I did on this project, and I am excited to show it off to potential employers.
Here are some additional details that you could include in your caption:
•	The purpose of the website
•	The features of the website
•	The technologies that you used
•	The challenges that you faced and how you overcame them
•	Your overall satisfaction with the project
By including these details, you will give potential employers a better understanding of your skills and experience. You will also show that you are passionate about your work and that you are committed to excellence.
