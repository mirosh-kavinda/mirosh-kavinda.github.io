# CountmeIn  
A cross-platform mobile application that uses image processing to count steel bars. The application also integrates with a system and database for efficient management of stocks and sales.

## Skills:
Python, flutter, dart language, Firebase, CNN algorithm, and

## Responsibility:
Project Leader and developer

## Methodology 

This application used Python script that appears to be a computer vision algorithm for steel bar detection in images. It uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) for candidate center detection and performs clustering to group the candidate centers. Finally, it shows the results by visualizing the candidate centers, bounding boxes around the clustered centers, and the final clustered centers.
